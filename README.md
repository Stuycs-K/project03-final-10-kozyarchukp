# RPS

Polina Kozyarchuk

### Project Description:
Simple rock paper scissors game. 
  
### Instructions:
After typing make run (or ./rps), type 'new' to create a game server. This server will ask for the number of players and number of rounds the players will play, type in your choices accordingly. Then, in a separate terminal for each player, run rps, and type 'join' to join the existing server. The game will prompt for a username and password; an account will be created if you type in an unrecognized username. Type start to start the game, then play!
*note: a directory called plr-files is required, though it should be created when you clone the repo.
